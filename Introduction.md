##  Android

**Android** is a **Linux-kernel-based mobile operating system** that provides a rich application framework and user interface for smartphones, tablets, wearables, TVs, and even cars.

* **Type**: Operating System
* **Based On**: Linux kernel + open-source libraries (like libc, WebKit)
* **User Interface**: Touch-based (also voice and gesture on some devices)
* **Languages Used**:

  * Java (initially primary language)
  * Kotlin (now officially recommended)
  * C/C++ (for low-level parts and native apps)

###  Question: What is Android? How is it different from normal Linux?

```
Android is a mobile operating system based on the Linux kernel, mainly used in smartphones, tablets, TVs, and cars. It is designed for touchscreen input, and runs apps written in Java, Kotlin, or C/C++.

The main difference is:
- Linux is a general-purpose OS used in desktops and servers.
- Android is made for mobile and embedded devices with a simple, app-based user interface.

##  History and Origin of Android

| Year | Milestone                                                                                                                                |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2003 | Android Inc. founded by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White. Originally for **digital cameras**, then pivoted to phones. |
| 2005 | Google acquired Android Inc. for \~\$50 million. Andy Rubin continued to lead the project.                                               |
| 2007 | Open Handset Alliance formed: Google, HTC, Sony, Samsung, Qualcomm, and others.                                                          |
| 2008 | First Android phone released: **HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1)**.                                                                               |

* Android is based on the **Linux kernel** for hardware abstraction.
* Uses **Dalvik VM** (later ART) to run apps, providing platform independence like Java.

##  OS's Used Before Android

Before Android dominated, the mobile OS market was shared by:

| OS                 | Used By        | Limitations                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Symbian**        | Nokia          | Limited UI, hard to develop apps             |
| **Java ME**        | Feature phones | No true OS capabilities                      |
| **Windows Mobile** | HTC, Motorola  | Business-focused, poor app support           |
| **BlackBerry OS**  | BlackBerry     | Good security, but not touchscreen-optimized |
| **Palm OS**        | Palm           | Early pioneer, died due to lack of evolution |

These platforms had limited multitasking, app ecosystems, and were closed-source — making development and innovation hard.

### Question: Why did Android become more popular than old mobile OS like Symbian?

```
Answer:
Android is free, open-source, easy to use, and has a huge app store. Older systems were closed and hard to develop for.
