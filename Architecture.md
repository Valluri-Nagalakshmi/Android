## **1. Applications**

Programs that users directly interact with.  
Applications are user programs that perform tasks for the user. They run in **User Space** (outside the kernel).

### **Examples:**

- Firefox: Web browser  
- VLC Player: Media Player  

### **Where It Runs:**

User Space → Uses system calls to request Kernel services.

---

## **2. Services (Daemons)**

Background processes that run continuously and provide core services.  
These are **system services** (often called **daemons**) that start at boot time or on demand and provide features to applications and users.

### **Examples:**

- sshd: Secure Shell (SSH) remote login service  
- systemd: Initializes and manages system services  
- udevd: Manages device nodes in /dev  

### **Where It Runs:**

User Space (Background processes), interacts with Kernel & Hardware via system calls.

---

## **3. Libraries**

Shared code that applications and services use.  
Libraries offer **pre-written functions** so programs don’t need to rewrite common functionalities.

### **Examples:**

- glibc: Standard C Library (memory, math, string functions)  
- libm: Math Library  
- libpthread: POSIX Threads (multithreading)  

### **Where It Runs:**

User Space (linked at runtime or compile time).

---

## **4. System Call Interface**

Acts as a bridge between **User Space** and **Kernel Space**.  
The **System Call Interface** allows applications and services to request services from the Kernel, such as file operations, process control, and device management.

### **Examples of System Calls:**

- `read()`: Read data from a file or device  
- `write()`: Write data to a file or device  
- `open()`: Open a file  

### **Where It Runs:**

It connects User Space and Kernel Space.  
User applications and services invoke system calls to interact with the Kernel.

---

## **5. Drivers (Kernel Modules)**

Programs that help the OS communicate with hardware devices.  
Device drivers are part of the **Kernel**. They provide control and communication with hardware components.

### **Examples:**

- Wi-Fi driver  
- USB driver  
- Bluetooth driver  

### **Where It Runs:**

Kernel Space (can be loaded/unloaded as modules).

---

## **6. Kernel**

Core part of the OS; manages hardware, memory, processes, and system calls.  
The Kernel is the **heart** of the operating system. It controls everything from process management to memory and hardware communication.

### **Examples of Kernel Features:**

- Process Management: Task scheduling, process creation (fork)  
- Memory Management: RAM allocation, virtual memory, paging  
- File System: Handling file systems  
- Networking Stack: Managing TCP/IP communication  

### **Where It Runs:**

Kernel Space (highest privilege level).

### Interview Questions

```
Question 1: What are system calls in Linux?

Answer:  
System calls are the interface between user space and kernel space. 
They allow user applications to request services like file operations, memory allocation, and device access.

```

```
Question 2: What is User Space and Kernel Space?

Answer:
- User Space is where user applications run (like your shell, browser, or text editor).  
- Kernel Space is where the core of the operating system runs — it manages CPU, memory, and hardware devices.
 
This separation keeps the system safe and stable — user applications cannot directly access or crash the hardware.
```

```

Question 3: What is a Shell in Linux?

Answer:  
A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the Linux system by entering commands.
