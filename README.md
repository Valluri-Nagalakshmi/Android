##  What Was Used Before Android?

Before Android dominated, the mobile OS market was shared by:

| OS                 | Used By        | Limitations                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Symbian**        | Nokia          | Limited UI, hard to develop apps             |
| **Java ME**        | Feature phones | No true OS capabilities                      |
| **Windows Mobile** | HTC, Motorola  | Business-focused, poor app support           |
| **BlackBerry OS**  | BlackBerry     | Good security, but not touchscreen-optimized |
| **Palm OS**        | Palm           | Early pioneer, died due to lack of evolution |

These platforms had limited multitasking, app ecosystems, and were closed-source — making development and innovation hard.
